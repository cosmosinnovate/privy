# privy README

This is the README for your extension "privy". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Privy is a locally-hosted AI assistant designed to enhance the coding experience in Visual Studio Code. By leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs), this tool provides intelligent code suggestions, autocompletions, and insights, all while ensuring complete data privacy and security by running entirely on your local machine.

After you run the app locally, you should see a screen open on the either right or left of your vscode.
